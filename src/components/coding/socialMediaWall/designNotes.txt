Admin Page: 
Break down into three distinct layouts. After a layout is selected, choose what item goes in each section. Each item has their own configurable layout version. Allow for complete control over color scheme and transition timings.

* Possible Items -
* . Social Media Feeds
* . . Facebook
* . . Instagram
* . . Twitter
* . . Pinterest??? (look into this)
* . Stock Images
* . Video from Vinmeo (maybe include youtube)

*  Layouts -
* . Full Screen
* . . One item at a time is on the screen, rotate between items with configurable transitions
* . Split Screens
* . . Choose 2 or 3 items to show at a time. Items do not need to be different types (an image surrounded by social media feeds)
* . Combiniation
* . . Switch between full screen and split screens.

* Transitions - All transitions have adjustable timings
* . Fade
* . Scroll

* Colors -
* . Theme colors
* . . User can choose a few colors (primary, secondary, etc...) and let system create view
* . Direct control
* . . Give user ability to choose every color that is not a media asset (images and videos) (.....maybe add filters if possible to images)

Ideas: 
To avoid creating users and storing credentials, I can create a password generator that you can supply to the display page to get your configuration.
I should start simple, instead of working on Direct color control, start with theme colors control.

Questions:
Should I consider a mobile view? Ideally this should always be on a bigger screen, but I could force Full Screen view on small displays. Maybe this will be a user configuration.
How much control over colors is to much?
Is it color or colour?
Is Pinterest possible intergration (Any apis?)
